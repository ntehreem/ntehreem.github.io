                        universe (the region of space from which light has had a chance to reach us within the last
                        13.77 billion years). By examining a very tiny portion of the sky, counting up the number of
                        visible galaxies in the universe in that specific region, and then multiplying that number to
                        account for all the regions of the sky, astronomers estimate the number of galaxies in the
                        universe. The best estimate from a 1999 study set that number at about 125 billion galaxies, and
                        a 2013 study indicated that there are 225 billion galaxies in the observable universe.</td>

                        galaxy (about 230 km per second toward Cygnus), M31 is still approaching the Milky Way by about
                        130 km per second. The two galaxies will merge a few billion years from now.</td>

                        velocity exceeds the speed of light. Nothing, not even light, can escape its pull.

                        Every object with mass creates its own gravitational field that exerts an attractive force on
                        surrounding objects. At every point in space, there is an associated escape velocity, which is
                        the speed necessary to escape that object's gravitational field and never come back. The escape
                        velocity at a particular point depends both on the mass of the attracting object and the
                        distance to its center.</td>

                        of spacetime looks like inside a black hole depends on that particular black hole's history. It
                        might be turbulent, twisted, or any other number of things. One thing's for sure, though: the
                        tidal forces would kill you (see below).

                        According to theory, within a black hole there's something called a singularity. A singularity
                        is what all the matter in a black hole gets crushed into. Some people talk about it as a point
                        of infinite density at the center of the black hole, but that's probably wrong — true, it's what
                        classical physics tells us is there, but the singularity is also where classical physics breaks
                        down, so we shouldn't trust what it says here.</td>

                    <td>What Is a Quasar?</td>

                        1963 as objects that looked like stars but emitted radio waves. Now, the term is a catch-all for
                        all feeding, and therefore luminous supermassive black holes, also often called active galactic
                        nuclei.

                        It's a bit of a contradiction to call a black hole luminous; black holes themselves are, of
                        course, black. In fact, almost every large galaxy hosts a black hole with the mass of millions
                        to billions of Suns, and many of these black holes lurk in the dark. Our Milky Way's behemoth
                        weighs in at 4.3 million solar masses, but its starvation diet mutes all but faint flashes and
                        flickers.</td>

                        black holes form through different processes. Stellar-mass black holes are born when very
                        massive stars (typically tens of solar masses) explode in supernovae. These explosions are some
                        of the most energetic phenomena in the universe. In a supernova, the outer layers of a dying
                        star are violently ejected into space, while the remaining core collapses under its own weight
                        to form a black hole.</td>

                        when stars twinkle: astronomical scintillation, an effect due to our planet's atmosphere. As
                        light travels through the blanket of air around our planet, it is diffracted (bounced around)
                        causing a quick apparent dimming and brightening — a star's signature "twinkle".

                        While some stars do physically change in brightness over time, they typically do so on long
                        timescales — amateur astronomers monitor these changes sometimes over hours, but more often over
                        days, weeks, or years. These variable stars are well studied and often signal complex physical
                        changes happening to the stars in question.</td>

                        the Sun is composed of all the colors of the rainbow. During the day, the molecules in the air
                        scatter the blue light from the Sun more that the red light making the sky appear blue. In the
                        evening, however, we see the red and orange colors because the blue light has been scattered
                        away from our line of sight.</td>

                        Since the speed of light is constant, it can also be used to measure vast distances. Distances
                        between objects in space are measured in light years. One light year is equal to the distance
                        light travels in a year, which is just under 6 trillion miles (10 trillion kilometers). The
                        speed of light is considered to be the ultimate speed limit in the universe. Scientists believe
                        that it is impossible to travel faster than light because any object traveling at the speed of
                        light would have to achieve infinite mass.</td>
