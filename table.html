                        stars are
                        called exoplanets. Exoplanets are very hard to see directly with telescopes. They are hidden by
                        the
                        bright glare of the stars they orbit.

                        Most of the exoplanets discovered so far are in a relatively small region of our galaxy, the
                        Milky Way.
                        We know from NASA's Kepler Space Telescope that there are more planets than stars in the galaxy.
                        <br>
                        The <strong>first exoplanets</strong> were discovered in the 1990s and since then we've
                        identified
                        thousands using a
                        variety of detection methods.

                    <td>Space has a great spectrum of colors regarding celestial bodies, and celestial bodies are
                        typically assorted into a spectral class according to their hue. Celestial bodies go through
                        phases of spectral evolution where they behave similarly to iron heated in a fire. Throughout
                        their evolutionary phases, they will shift from red to orange, yellow, white, or blue as they
                        reach their hottest phases. Depending on trace amounts of elements — aside from hydrogen and
                        helium — stars may appear in cooler secondary colors like purple and green.

                        Stars can exhibit the following colors, in order from hottest to coldest:
                        <li>
                            <ul>O: Blue</ul>
                            <ul>B: Blue/White</ul>
                            <ul>A: White</ul>
                            <ul>F: White/Yellow</ul>
                            <ul>G: Yellow</ul>
                            <ul>K: Orange</ul>
                            <ul>M: Orange/Red</ul>
                        </li>


                        Around 88% of all stars in our universe are of the K and M variety, while G stars like the sun
                        make up only 8% of celestial bodies. But while most of the universe may be orange and red, it's
                        also home to impressive blues, greens, purples, reds and whites.

                        photos you've probably seen, scientists add the color later, using a technique developed around
                        the turn of the 20th century that imitates how our eyes naturally perceive color. <br>

                        Only a fraction of the range of frequencies of light and their wavelengths, called the
                        electromagnetic spectrum, is visible to humans. The photoreceptors in our eyes, called “cone
                        cells,”
                        perceive wavelengths of light that appear roughly red, green, and blue. All other colors are
                        combinations of these three, and they're known as the primary colors of light.

                        When Hubble scientists take photos of space, they use filters to record specific wavelengths of
                        light. Later, they add red, green, or blue to color the exposures taken through those filters.
                        The
                        result is full-color images that have a variety of purposes for scientific analysis.
